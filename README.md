## *Saccharomyces* species composition (sppComp)

An automated modular computational framework for a rapid glympse to the species composition and genomics features of *Saccharomyces* yeasts from large datasets of paired-end illumina reads, adtapt to deal different computational resourses.

SppComp is realeased as part of the (SGRP5 project)[]. 

SppComp allows the detection of: 

- hybrids
- hybrid ploidy (3n and 4n [3n + n])
- introgressed DNA
- aneuploidies (relative number)
- copy number variations (CNVs)

## Description
  
The species composition of *Saccharomyces* strains plays a major role in biological studies providing valuable insights in the evolutionary history of the *genus* while being exploited for improving indutrial phenotypes. Short-read sequencing are the most popular choice for large-scale genomics projects due to their rapid processesing and affordable prices. As a leading model organisms, the *Saccharomyces* yeasts, heve been massively sequenced with short reads Illumina platfroms. **SppComp** takes advantage of the chromosome-level end-to-end genome assemblies produced/reannotated with [LRSDAY](https://github.com/yjx1217/LRSDAY), SCrapDB and competitive short read mapping, as implemented and described in [MuLo-YDH](https://bitbucket.org/lt11/muloydh/src/master/), to assess the species composition of *Saccharomyces* yeasts from large datasets of paired-end illumina reads. **SppComp** is written in bash and R. By means the implementation of state-of-the-art softwares, [functional programming](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Functional-programming.html), [vectorised code](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/perf-improve.html#vectorise), **SppComp** reduces computational slowdowns, allowing a full control of the processes.

SppComp runner is provided in two different constructs:

- ```sppComp.sh``` : a bash script for CLI use
- ```sppComp.Rmd``` : a Rmarkdown script for GUI use (Rstudio)

Both the constructs run the same scripts but while ```sppComp.sh``` allows an agile editing from CLI it remains more suitable for large datasets on a server computer. On the other hand, ```sppComp.Rmd``` is recommended for people that prefer the use of the GUI. ```sppComp.Rmd``` ends with the generation of a report (HTML/PDF) which better fit with a run of a few samples.
